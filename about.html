<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in June 13th, 1982 which makes me almost 41 as of when I wrote this. I have been interested in technology since I first saw a kid toy computer when I was 4. 
  I got a degree in computer information technology from a small college in Naples, FL called Hodges University. After some time in tech support at entry level jobs in Florida and Tennessee
  I decided to grow my knowledge by taking this web development class so I can make sick web solutions for other people with ambitious plans to eventually branch out on my own to do either computer repair or web sites or both
